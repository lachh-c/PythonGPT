To Download this file go to my discord at
https://discord.gg/ssp5Utf7Gz
and go to the channel "Python gpt"
Then go to the text channel "Download" and hit download on the google drive link for it as it is far to big for github.

This is not customizable (as far as i know) because the file is in a exe but it still has all of the normal stuff the normal one will do.
